<h2> <u>Lemon Bars: <i> a preface<i></u></h1>

<p> Lemon Bars were my introduction to lemons made in a mushy manner <p>

<p> My dad used to only buy a few things from the store when he was getting something sweet; those small cardboard box fruit pies, minute maid popsicles and these Krusteaz lemon bars. The pies weren't real pies they were made with chalk or something but he liked them, and the minute maid popsicles were kind of his precious so he didnt let anyone near those. <br></br>
    The Lemon Bars were different though, there was some preparation involved and it had to be baked and refrigerated. Because of the sort of mini event that they were, everyone knew exactly when they were being made so it was kind of pointless to hide them. But even so, theyd sit around for a while and hed more or less eat them at his leisure anyway.    <hr style="color: red;"></hr>
    Reason being, they weren't that good. There was something uniquely off about the lemon curd, it was sour and sweet in the way that a sourpatch kid is. But it didnt even lean fully into that becuase it also had a weird kind of imitation lemony taste going on top of that. Those two factors plus the fact that it was cold made it a little too strange for them to become a monumental dessert for me. Looking back though, I guess they were the start so Ill give credit. </p>

<p> Now I cant really remember my first Meringue pie, but I can remember the first time that citrusy goodness got a hold of me. It was at my grandparents house im pretty sure. My granddad had bought a pie and offered me a slice. Now my granddad is and always has been the healthiest man Ive ever known, I mean a daily gym goer for my whole life +. Everything he consumes has an ultimate health benefit in some form. <br><br>All this to say, he offered me that slice and I accepted. I sat down and took my first bite, it was almost like that Ratatouille scene with the swirling imagination flavor bubbles when Remy and his brother ate the cheese and strawberries; yea.I loved it, I went to get a second slice not 10 minutes later and this healthy man came out of his room with an empty pie container. Its in the blood.

<p> Now the moment time I had fresh lemon bars was a different experience entirely. My sister had been on a dessert making spree of sorts and was kinda just firing things out. Well she made these lemon bars, which was no small task. Im talking trillions dessicated lemons littering the linoleum. It smelled amazing.<br><br> I took my first bite curiously, ignorantly. Little did I know that that cold tang on my teeth would become a thrill Id feverishly seek evermore. The shortbread, a hardy constitution that only cracked and gave when the time was right, and it knows the right time better than you, it always does. And the way all the acid kind of burns a little going down. Sheesh </p>
