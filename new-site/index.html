            <p class="boomy">The foot has become <i>increasingly less present</i> in the web as we know it today. Walking is automated or built from templates, and the knowledge of how to make a step is relegated to a select few. It has only gotten easier to learn and make on the web, but the idea and perceived requirements for a walk have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject. 
                <br><br>
                This walk seeks to dispel these ideas and will <b>emphasize the step-quality of walking by developing an understanding of the best practices, language, history, and present context of the step.</b> We will examine the space of the print at large and explore and challenge what a step is and can be with the hopes of reclaiming an important powerful form.</p>
